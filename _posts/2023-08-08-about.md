# Hello, everyone! I am Daebeom Kim.

I'm thrilled to introduce myself to you. 

I hold a degree in **Automobile and IT Convergence** from **Kookmin University** and am currently pursuing my master's degree at **Robotics Program**, **KAIST**, where I am immersing myself in the world of robotics and technology.

I'm currently in **[Urban Robotics Lab.](https://urobot.kaist.ac.kr/)** My primary research revolves around **robotics and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** techniques. Through my work, I strive to develop autonomous robot movement in urban environments, incorporating cutting-edge technologies to enhance indoor positioning and mapping.

I embrace challenges with open arms and relish the opportunity to learn new skills and concepts. Confronted with complex problems, I approach them with unwavering determination, seeking innovative solutions. My passion and proactive mindset drive me to give my best in any situation, as I continuously explore new avenues of possibility.🔥🔥🔥

I'm excited to share more insights and updates through my blog, where we can engage in meaningful discussions and explore the frontiers of technology together. 

Thank you!😀
